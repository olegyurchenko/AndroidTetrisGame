    The idea was borrowed from the old computer DOS game.

<H2>Rules</h2>
<p>Figures in the form of column, consisting of three squares arranged vertically one under the other, with random color,
    falling from the top in a rectangular
    glass width 10 and a height of 20 cells.
    <Sup> <a href="#rlink1"> (1) </a> </sup>.
</p>


<p>In flight, the player can change the location of the colored squares in column and move it horizontally.
</p>

<p>It is also possible "to drop" a figure, that is to accelerate its falling when it is already solved where the figure shall fall. </p>

<p> The figure flies until comes across other figure or a glass bottom. </p>

<p> After the fall, all the squares bordering the squares of the same color vertically, horizontally and diagonally
    destroyed. All squares that destroyed above, falls into one cell.
</p>

<p> A game comes to an end when the new figure can't be located in a glass. </p>

<p> A player gets points for every square cut, so his goal - to put column color to color
    without filling the glass itself (vertical) as long as possible, so as to get as many points. </p>
