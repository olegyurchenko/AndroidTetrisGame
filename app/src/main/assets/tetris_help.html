    The game has been developed based on Tetris - commuter game created by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">see wikipedia</a>).
    The main difference - figures which represent Tetris is combination of the four squares, in the "Bricks" -
    combinations of squares in accordance with the level of complexity.
</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Random figures fall from above into a rectangular glass width 10 and height 20 cells.
    <sup><a href="#rlink1">(1)</a></sup>.
</p>


<p>In flight, the player can rotate the figure by 90Â° and move it horizontally.</p>

<p>Also, you can "drop" figure, that is, to accelerate its fall, when it is decided where the figure should fall.</p>

<p>Figure flies until stumble on until another figure or bottom of beaker.</p>

<p>If at the same time filled with a horizontal row of 10 cells, it disappears and all that is above it,
    drops per cell.</p>

<p>In addition, the figure shows that will follow after the current - a hint,
    which allows the player to plan actions.</p>

<p>The game ends when a new figure can not fit into the glass.</p>

<p>The player receives points for each completed row, so its task - to fill in the ranks,
    without filling the glass itself (vertical) as long as possible, so as to get as many points as possible.</p>
