<h2> Rules </h2>
<p> Random figures fall on top in a rectangular glass 10 wide and 20 cells high.
    <sup> <a href="#rlink1">(1)</a></sup>.
</p>


<p>In flight, the player can rotate the figure by 90 ° and move it horizontally.</p>

<p> It is also possible "to drop" a figure, that is to accelerate its falling when it is already solved where the figure shall fall. </p>

<p> The figure flies until comes across other figure or a glass bottom. </p>

<p> If at the same time a horizontal row from 10 cells was filled, it disappears also everything that above it,
    falls by one cell. </p>

<p> In addition the figure which will follow after current is shown is a hint,
    which allows to plan to the player of action. </p>

<p> A game comes to an end when the new figure can't be located in a glass. </p>

<p> The player receives points for each filled row therefore its task — to fill rows,
    without filling a glass (down) as long as possible thus to receive as much as possible points. </p>
