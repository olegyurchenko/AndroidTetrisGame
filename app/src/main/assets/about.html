<p>
The program is designed for personal satisfaction, and as a tool in the fight against tobacco addiction personally.
</p>

<p>
    A side benefit of creating this program I got as a practice of programming in JAVA and development for
    Android with Android Studio.
</p>

<p>
    I hope that the games from this collection will not cause irritation in my users, if found.
</p>

<p>
    The text of the program you can be found at <a href="https://github.com/olegyurchenko/AndroidTetrisGame">github.com</a>.
    I will be glad if you join design and enter your name in the next paragraph.
